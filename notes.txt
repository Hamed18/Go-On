POST http://localhost:4000/api/teams/register

Would you like me to give you the TypeScript RTK Query slice (teamRegistration.api.ts) to handle this endpoint cleanly from the frontend too? It’ll plug directly into your existing baseApi.

the uid in playerschema needs to be unique. 
if uid is already stored in the database collection the server will send a response 
that the uid already registered before and the requested data will not be stored in the database.

error in route.ts:
No overload matches this call. The last overload gave the following error. Argument of type '(req: Request, res: Response) => Promise<Response<any, Record<string, any>> | undefined>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Application<Record<string, any>>'. Type '(req: Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>, res: Response<any, Record<string, any>>) => Promise<...>' is missing the following properties from type 'Application<Record<string, any>>': init, defaultConfiguration, engine, set, and 63 more.ts(2769) index.d.ts(168, 5): The last overload is declared here. (property) createTeam: (req: express.Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, QueryString.ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>, res: express.Response) => Promise<express.Response<any, Record<string, any>> | undefined>
Solution:
explicitly returning nothing from controller functions so that TypeScript sees them as Promise<void> instead of Promise<Response | undefined>.
Code:
const createTeam = async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const team = await TeamRegistrationService.createTeam(req.body);
    res.status(201).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Team registered successfully!",
      data: team,
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Team registration error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
};
